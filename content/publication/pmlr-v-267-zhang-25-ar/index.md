abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective for learning from graph-structured
  data through their neighborhood-based message passing framework. Many hierarchical
  graph clustering pooling methods modify this framework by introducing clustering-based
  strategies, enabling the construction of more expressive and powerful models. However,
  all of these message passing framework heavily rely on the connectivity structure
  of graphs, limiting their ability to capture the rich geometric features inherent
  in geometric graphs. To address this, we propose Rhomboid Tiling (RT) clustering,
  a novel clustering method based on the rhomboid tiling structure, which performs
  clustering by leveraging the complex geometric information of the data and effectively
  extracts its higher-order geometric structures. Moreover, we design RTPool, a hierarchical
  graph clustering pooling model based on RT clustering for graph classification tasks.
  The proposed model demonstrates superior performance, outperforming 21 state-of-the-art
  competitors on all the 7 benchmark datasets.
